## Tech Stack
 * MySQL for database which will include most business logic
 * Vanilla Node (TypeScript) web server
   * Just two layers:
     1. expose REST API
     2. call MySQL stored procedures
 * TypeScript SPA client
     * minimal HTML/CSS
     * Use standard browser APIs
 * EC2 free tier hosting in fresh AWS account

## Next Steps
 3. npm init
 4. add the actual web server

## Additional Notes (for future reference)
 *  use like xampp or wamp for manage maria db and phpmyadmin or any other client (for some future project)
 * what is inner join? what is outer join?
   * in inner join
